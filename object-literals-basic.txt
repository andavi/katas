The object literal allows for new shorthands
with variables
the short version for `{x: x}` is {x} ‣
works with multiple variables too ‣
with methods
using the name only uses it as key ‣
a different key must be given explicitly, just like before ES6 ‣
inline functions, can written as `obj={func(){}}` instead of `obj={func:function(){}}` ‣
